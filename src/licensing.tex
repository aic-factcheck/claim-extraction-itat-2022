\section{Licensing}
\hu{Note this section is probably temporary and its contents will be distributed into appropriate previous sections once resolved. \todo{Remove}}

\hu{\url{https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~popel/npfl070/slides/authors_rights_intro.pdf} -- Good and easily digestible reading on the topics -- generally we want to use CC BY (\q{Attribution} -- citation required) + SA (\q{Share alike})}

\subsection{Licenses of used data}
Necessary to keep an eye on -- may be restrictive, so we may need to contact authors for an extra permission:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item DeepL translation -- we care about the \q{\textbf{processed content}} terms entity -- it mostly looks like free use as long as we give a DeepL company name and link, see: \url{https://www.deepl.com/pro-license/}

    \textit{All rights regarding the Content, Processed Content and/or Customer Training Data remain with Customer. However, Customer grants DeepL the non-exclusive worldwide right to use the Content and/or Customer Training Data solely in order to provide DeepLâ€™s services to Customer. In particular, Customer grants to DeepL the right to temporarily store, modify, process, translate and transmit the Content and/or Customer Training Data, and to sublicense the foregoing rights to its subcontractors, to the extent required to provide the services set out in this Agreement}
    \item CTK dataset -- proprietary, need to discuss permission
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\rightarrow$ for \CTKNLI, Herbert proposes some version of CC-BY-SA
        \item $\rightarrow$ maybe we could make a SQLite DR sandbox out of the permitted CTK articles? not for full reproducibility, just technical/debug convenience (sth like \texttt{ctk\_filtered10000.db}) 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \FEN{} -- CC-BY-SA 3.0 -- \url{https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/fever.public/license.html}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\rightarrow$ \FCZ must be CC-BY-SA 3.0 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \FEVERNLI{} -- MIT License -- but must cite~\cite{nie2019combining} \url{https://github.com/easonnie/combine-FEVER-NSMN/blob/master/other_resources/nli_fever.md}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\rightarrow$ we can freely publish \FCZ-NLI under CC-BY-SA as long as we cite
    \end{itemize}
    \item NLI datasets: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item SNLI CC-BY (\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/snli}) $\rightarrow$ only attribution required
        \item ANLI CC-BY-NC (\url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/anli/blob/main/LICENSE}) $\rightarrow$ attribution and non-profit flag required
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
